# TS-Restockplus
A tool to generate a Tweakscale file by parsing Restockplus parts including rigid legs.
Also works with the NearFuture Solar Mod.

The tool is currently being designed in the dev branch so that it could be
- more flexible
- can handle properly FOR and NEEDS statements of TweakScale 2.5
- better at finding the scaling method for some parts (solar panels with a size, mostly)
- compliant with the "Companion" AddOn design like TweakScaleCompanion_NFS made by Lisias https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScaleCompanion_NFS
